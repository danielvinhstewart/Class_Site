        <h3>Adele &amp; John's Wedding</h3>

        <p><img src="portfolio/weddings/AdeleandJohn/images/AdeleandJohnWedding1.jpg" alt="Adele and John 1" /></p>

        <p>

            Adele &amp; John wanted some wedding photos of just themselves
            around Sydney Harbour with the <em>Sydney Opera House, Botanical Gardens</em> and
            <em>Sydney Harbour Bridge</em> as the backdrop. We met up with them one sunny afternoon on
            the <em>Sydney Opera House</em> steps and spent some time capturing some greats shots of them
            both in these awe-inspiring locations. After shooting in front of the <em>Opera House</em> and <em>Harbour Bridge</em>,
            we walked into <em>Sydney's Botanical Gardens</em> with the city behind them and captured some great
            natural moments between the two of them. After a glass or two of Champagne, we
            wandered through the gardens to <em>Mrs Macquaries Point</em> and photographed the bride and groom
            with the iconic <em>Opera House</em> and <em>Harbour Bridge</em> behind them.

        <h3>Jane and Richard's Wedding</h3>

        <p><img src="portfolio/weddings/JaneandRichard/images/JanandRichardWedding1.jpg" alt="Jane and Richard 1" /></p>

        <p>

            Jane &amp; Richard's wedding was at <em>St. Wilfrid's Church,
            Calverley</em> and the wedding reception took place at the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel Leeds</em>.
            All the groomsmen were in kilts as the groom is Scottish and there was definitely
            a Scottish theme to the day. After the ceremony we were lucky enough for some sunshine
            to come out just at the right moment so the bride and groom could have the roof down
            on the wedding car. We worked quickly in the short time we had sun to capture some
            great photos of the bride and groom through the trees with the sunshine behind outside
            the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel</em>. The wedding speeches had everyone in stitches as the best man
            had prepared a slideshow of photos from the stag do!
